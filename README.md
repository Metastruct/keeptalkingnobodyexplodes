A remake of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes in Garry's Mod
This does not represent the final product, meaning all files are subject to change. This may be really buggy, especially with networking (it uses several NWVars which I will divert from in a future version). *Do not expect this to work 100% of the time!*

All files in the sound folder do not belong to me. They belong to the original creators of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes. If the original creators wish for them to be removed from this repository, please let me know.
